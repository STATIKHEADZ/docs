## What is Wurk?

Wurk is the work layer of Web3, a platform where humans, creators, communities, and intelligent agents collaborate, create value, and grow together.

With the Wurk API, you can programmatically create jobs, manage submissions, and process x402 payments. This means agents, bots, or back-end systems can automatically publish tasks, reward users, and collect verified human input, all without leaving your environment.

The API is flexible and can be integrated into a wide range of workflows:
- Agents that need human-in-the-loop assistance
- Telegram or Discord bots that create and manage jobs
- Campaign systems that automate social or creative tasks
- Automated surveys

This API acts as the bridge between automation and human creativity, powering a new layer of digital work where value, energy, and effort flow seamlessly on-chain.
