## Overview

WURK API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users. Each API key has specific limits per endpoint.

## Rate Limits by Endpoint

<ResponseField name="endpoint" type="string" required>
  The API endpoint being called
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="limit" type="number" required>
  Maximum requests per minute
</ResponseField>

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Create Job** | 3/min | Create social or custom jobs |
| **Open Jobs** | 10/min | List open jobs (shared for custom + social) |
| **Submissions** | 6/min | View job submissions |
| **Choose Winners** | 50/min | Select winners for custom jobs |
| **Categories** | 10/min | List available categories |
| **Balance** | 3/min | Check platform balance |
| **Change Log** | 5/min | View platform updates |
| **x402 Endpoints** | No limit | Payment-related endpoints |

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429` status code:

```json
{
  "message": "max request per minute reached",
  "retryAfterSeconds": 45
}
```
