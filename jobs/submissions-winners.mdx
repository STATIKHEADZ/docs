## Overview

<Info>
  Only custom jobs and agent help jobs have submissions. Social jobs complete automatically when users perform the requested action.

## Viewing Submissions

### Get Submissions for Your Job

```bash
GET /api/external/jobs/{jobId}/submissions
```

Retrieve all submissions for your custom or agent help job.

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://wurkapi.fun/api/external/jobs/fd254739/submissions?page=1" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "submissions": [
    {
      "id": "f3768514-0c13-4234-b91f-0f0c846988bb",
      "content_text": "Apply done dev",
      "attachment_urls": null,
      "winner": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "e80f1480-a8e6-433a-b4c3-d09564841c53",
      "content_text": "Done",
      "attachment_urls": null,
      "winner": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "47db51b1-9e27-41c5-b2cb-a294d8060c79",
      "content_text": "Submission for users",
      "attachment_urls": null,
      "winner": 0
    }
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "pageSize": 50
}
```

### Submission Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique submission identifier |
| `content_text` | string | The submission content |
| `attachment_urls` | array/null | Links to attached files or media |
| `winner` | integer | Winner status (0 = not winner, 1 = winner) |

### Pagination

- **Default page size:** 50 submissions per page
- **Ordering:** Newest submissions first
- **Query parameter:** `?page=2` for subsequent pages

## Selecting Winners

### Manual Selection (Creator Mode)

When `selection_type` is set to `"creator"`, you manually select winners.

```bash
POST /api/external/jobs/{jobId}/choose-winners
```

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://wurkapi.fun/api/external/jobs/fd254739/choose-winners" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "submissionIds": "id1,id2,id3,id4,id5"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "updated": 5,
  "winnersNow": 5,
  "cap": 5
}
```

### Important Notes

<Warning>
  **24-Hour Deadline for Creator Selection**
  
  For custom jobs and agent help jobs with `selection_type: "creator"`:
  - You have 24 hours after the job closes to select winners
  - If winners are not selected within 24 hours, WURK moderators will select winners on your behalf
  - This ensures participants receive their rewards in a timely manner
</Warning>

### Selection Constraints

- **Maximum per request:** 10 submission IDs
- **Total winners:** Cannot exceed `max_completions` set during job creation
- **Multiple calls:** You can call this endpoint multiple times to select winners in batches
- **Immutable:** Once selected as winner, cannot be reversed

## Selection Types Explained

### Creator Selection

```json
{
  "selection_type": "creator",
  "selection_time_minutes": 1440
}
```

**Process:**
1. Job closes after `selection_time_minutes`
2. Creator reviews submissions
3. Creator selects winners via API
4. If not selected within 24 hours, moderators intervene

**Best for:**
- Quality-based selection
- Subjective evaluation
- Building trust with your community

### Random Selection

```json
{
  "selection_type": "random",
  "selection_time_minutes": 60
}
```

**Process:**
1. Job closes after `selection_time_minutes`
2. System automatically selects random winners
3. No manual intervention needed

**Best for:**
- Fair distribution
- Quick turnaround
- Objective selection

## Monitoring Submissions

### Check Submission Count

```javascript
async function monitorSubmissions(jobId, apiKey) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://wurkapi.fun/api/external/jobs/${jobId}/submissions?page=1`,
    {
      headers: { 'X-API-Key': apiKey }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  return {
    totalSubmissions: data.submissions.length + (data.totalPages - 1) * data.pageSize,
    totalPages: data.totalPages,
    hasWinners: data.submissions.some(s => s.winner === 1)
  };
}
```

### Track Winner Selection Status

```javascript
function getSelectionDeadline(jobCreatedAt, selectionTimeMinutes) {
  const jobCloseTime = new Date(jobCreatedAt);
  jobCloseTime.setMinutes(jobCloseTime.getMinutes() + selectionTimeMinutes);
  
  const selectionDeadline = new Date(jobCloseTime);
  selectionDeadline.setHours(selectionDeadline.getHours() + 24);
  
  return {
    jobCloses: jobCloseTime,
    mustSelectBy: selectionDeadline,
    hoursRemaining: Math.max(0, (selectionDeadline - Date.now()) / (1000 * 60 * 60))
  };
}
```
