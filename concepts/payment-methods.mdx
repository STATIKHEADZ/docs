## Overview

WURK offers two payment methods for job creation, each with unique advantages:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="x402 USDC Payments" icon="coins">
    Direct on-chain payments using Solana USDC with the x402 protocol
  </Card>
  <Card title="Platform Balance" icon="wallet">
    Pre-funded SOL balance for job activation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## x402 USDC Payments

The x402 protocol enables HTTP-based cryptocurrency payments. When you create a job with USDC payment:

1. Job is created with status `"unpaid"`
2. You receive payment requirements
3. You send USDC payment via x402
4. Job activates upon confirmation

### How x402 Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Job">
    Specify `total_usdc` in your job creation request:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "social",
      "total_usdc": 5.0,
      // ... other parameters
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Payment Requirements">
    Request returns 402 status with payment details:
    ```bash
    GET /api/x402/jobs/{jobId}/pay
    ```
    
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "x402Version": 1,
      "accepts": [
        {
          "scheme": "exact",
          "network": "solana",
          "maxAmountRequired": "2500000",
          "resource": "https://wurkapi.fun/api/x402/jobs/61038823/pay",
          "description": "",
          "mimeType": "",
          "payTo": "SAT8g2xU7AFy7eUmNJ9SNrM6yYo7LDCi13GXJ8Ez9kC",
          "asset": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
          "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
          "extra": {
            "feePayer": "2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Payment">
    Use x402 client library to create and send payment:
    ```javascript
    const xPayment = await createPaymentHeader(signer, x402Version, selected);
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Payment">
    Send request with X-PAYMENT header:
    ```bash
    GET /api/x402/jobs/{jobId}/pay
    Headers: X-PAYMENT: {payment_proof}
    ```
    
    Success response:
    ```json
    {
      "ok": true,
      "paid": true,
      "jobId": "abc123"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

    - 10 completions: $0.10 minimum
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  USDC payments are automatically converted to SOL within the WURK platform. This ensures seamless reward distribution, as all wurker payouts are processed in SOL.
</Note>

<Note>
  Since Wurk distributes all rewards in SOL, all payments in USDC will be automatically swapped to SOL. This also means that if there is a problem with a job and a refund is necessary, it will be made in the SOL value at the job creation time.
</Note>

## Platform Balance (SOL)

Platform balance allows you to deposit SOL once and create multiple jobs without individual transactions.

### How Balance Payments Work

1. Deposit SOL to your Wurk account balance
2. Set `balance_payment: 1` and specify `total_bounty_sol`
3. Job activates instantly with status `"pending"`
4. Balance is deducted immediately

### Using Balance Payments

```json
{
  "type": "social",
  "balance_payment": 1,
  "total_bounty_sol": 0.15,
  // ... other parameters
}
```

<Note>
  Your account must have sufficient balance before creating the job. Check balance with `GET /api/external/balance`.
</Note>
